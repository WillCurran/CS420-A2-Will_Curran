Topic: Game Search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax)

The solutions to these pac-man search problems were completed by Will Curran, a student at Texas A&M University, taking CSCE 420, Artificial Intelligence, with Dr. Shell. This repository is public as a way to showcase the project to potential employers, not to be a resource for students taking this class.
